Trying something new

# Summary - about me
This is my career website I builted. I am in information technology [IT]. I specialize in organizing data sets and metrics. In addition, I am familiar with Cybersecurity concepts

My motto is identify a purpose that resonances with you. Find a goal you want to chase, choose a plan of action to reach that goal, and follow through it.

My purpose it to invest in myself. Learn new skills to open up more ways to find solutions to issues. It helps me grow to something better than what I was yesterday.
